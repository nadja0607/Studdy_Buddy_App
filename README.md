Study Buddy is a website developed for use by the student body of a particular educational institution. The system pairs up a student with another student based on their studying preferences for the purpose of studying together. This system aims to fosters a greater sense of connection between students, inspired especially by the isolating time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The system also aims to boost productivity levels of the student body through collaborative work.    

Major functionalities our system provides for students: 
1. Students can register and login to website through Multi-Factor Authentication, as well as logout. A logged in student is considered online and ready to be matched!
2. Students can enter their preferences for a study partner: academic year, major, and gender. All these include a no preference option. 
3. Students can prompt system to find a suitable study buddy for them according to their pre-set studying preferences. The system will return five suitable matches at a time.
