Study Buddy is a **website** developed for use by the student body of a particular educational institution. **The system pairs up a student with another to study together** based on their study partner preferences. This system aims to fosters a greater sense of connection between students, inspired especially by the isolating time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The system also aims to boost productivity levels of the student body through collaborative work.    

**Major functionalities our system provides:**   
1. Students can **register** and **login** to website through Multi-Factor Authentication, as well as **logout**. A logged in student is considered online and ready to be matched!
2. Students can **enter their preferences for a study partner**: academic year, major, and gender. All these include a no preference option. 
3. Students can prompt system to **find a suitable study buddy** for them according to their pre-set studying preferences. The system will return five suitable matches at a time.

**Tools Used:**
- Sublime Text Editor
- Cross-platform web server Xampp
- PhpMyAdmin software tool for handling MySQL databases
